# InvertedSearch

## Overview

InvertedSearch is a tool designed to optimize search functionality by utilizing an inverted index data structure. This approach enables rapid full-text searches by mapping words to their locations within a set of documents. Instead of scanning every document, the system uses an index to quickly locate relevant files, significantly improving search speed and efficiency.

## Goals

- Optimize Search Performance: By creating an efficient inverted index, the system reduces the time and resources needed to find documents that contain specific words.
- Enable Fast Querying: Implement a robust querying mechanism that provides quick results by leveraging the pre-built index.
- Maintain Flexibility: Allow for easy updating of the index as files are added or removed from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Hashing: Understanding of hash tables for efficient data retrieval.
- Single Linked List: Basic knowledge of linked lists for storing and managing index data.

## Complexity Level

- Complex

## Introduction

An inverted index maps content (such as words) to its locations in a database or set of documents, allowing for rapid full-text searches. This data structure is fundamental in search engines and document retrieval systems. While building the index involves some overhead, it greatly enhances search query performance.

## Features

- Indexing: Create and maintain an index of words from a set of files.
- Searching: Efficiently query the indexed data to find relevant documents based on user input.
